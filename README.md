## Introduction

This repository contains code examples, exercises, and detailed explanations of the design patterns covered in the "Head First Design Patterns" book. The goal is to provide a hands-on approach to learning and applying these patterns to real-world software development scenarios.

## Design Patterns Covered

The repository includes implementations and explanations for the following design patterns:

- Strategy
- Observer
- Decorator
- Factory
- Singleton
- Command
- Adapter
- Facade
- Template Method
- Iterator
- Composite
- State
- Proxy

## Structure

The repository is organized into directories for each design pattern. Each directory contains:

- **Examples**: Practical examples illustrating the design pattern in use.
- **Exercises**: Coding exercises to practice implementing the design pattern.
- **Documentation**: Detailed explanations and comments within the code to aid understanding.

Example directory structure:

├── Strategy
│ ├── examples
│ ├── exercises
│ └── README.md
├── Observer
│ ├── examples
│ ├── exercises
│ └── README.md

## Setup and Requirements

To run the examples and exercises, you will need:

- A Java Development Kit (JDK) installed (version 8 or higher)
- An IDE or text editor of your choice (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VSCode, Vim/NeoVim)

### Running the Examples

1. Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/LucasGualtieri/DesignPatterns.git
```
2. Navigate to the desired design pattern directory and compile the Java files:

```sh
javac examples/*.java
```

3. Run the compiled Java files:
```sh
java examples.YourExampleClass
```
